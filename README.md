[App that DOE already built](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)

## Ideas:

- Looking at college as an investment:
  - ROI of different types of degrees (2-year, 4-year, etc)
  - Earnings power across majors and types of degrees (Associates, Bachelors)
- Shiny App:
  - Inputs: Major/cost/salary/lifetime earnings
- Regional cost of education (Choropleth?)
- Cost of Public vs Private Colleges / For-Profit vs Non-Profit
- Relative cost of college majors
- Cost of living at different colleges
- How mush does college actuall cost considering financial aid/ scholarships
- Region of college vs region of employment opportunities
- Sports budget vs tuition/region/cost
- Racial and ethnic demographics across schools
